This plugin syncronises the inventory between a WooCommerce instance and an
Amazon seller account using the MWS API.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically syncronises the inventory between a WooCommerce
instance and an Amazon seller account using the MWS API.

Product inventories are syncronised based purely on their SKU values.

Adding inventory from the Amazon store is not currently supported, please
refill shop inventory via your WooCommerce shop instead.

1. Download and activate the plugin.

```
// AWS API Key

Make sure the products you want to sync have the exact same SKU values in
WooCommerce and the Amazon Seller Central. Also, make sure SKU names don't
clash for any products you don't want to syncronise vai this plugin.

4. Installation done! The first sync should happen within the first 30
minutes, as MWS generates the first inventory report.
